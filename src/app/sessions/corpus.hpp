 * act of recording text and linking it to its recorded audio to ensure that upon
 * the act of compiling a model, whether or not one is adapting or building, that
 * the appropriate text is linked up with its appropriate audio segment.
 *
 * This class allows developers to learn more, however, about not only what's been
 * recorded but also when did training begin, how much time has been poured into the
 * training process and when did it end. Since all of the information is stored to XML,
 * the amount of information that can be stored into the corpuses are only limited by
 * the capacity of XML.
