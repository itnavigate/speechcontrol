/*!
 * \mainpage The %SpeechControl Application
 *
 * %SpeechControl's primary goal is to provide efficient and simple speech recognition
 * services to the Linux desktop (or whichever desktop it happens to be compiled on).
 * Using CMU's Sphinx speech recognition libraries and the Voxforge collective, we take
 * on a task never to be ventured before by a open-source community. It happens to also
 * be one of the many applications to be released by the Synthetic Intellect Institute.
 *
 * Visit the Synthetic Intellect Institute on the web at http://www.thesii.org.
 * The bug tracker for the Institute is at http://tasks.thesii.org and SpeechControl's
 * registered under the tracker as a component. Feel free to report bugs and help us
 * make %SpeechControl a fantastic, open-source tool.
